           Zm_Polyhedron - Speccy of the future ???

                  Phoenix  Interviews Raydac

<Phx> Where do you live?
<Ray> I living in St.Petersburg city (in Russia).
<Phx> How's the spectrum scene there nowadays?
<Ray> ZX-Net 400. Chaos Construction'99.
<Ray> At us many people are engaged in a Spectrum. In ZX-Net the
      approximately   400   men. The   summer   will carry   out
      (spent) a festival Chaos Construction'99.
<Phx> Seems like it is still a cool scene!
<Phx> How does zx-net work?
<Ray> Has not understood. Set a question more correct.
<Phx> Shite...
<Phx> Is it BBS-driven?
<Ray> Yes
<Phx> Ok ...
<Phx> There are modems available for which computers?
<Ray> Scorpion and Pentagon.
<Ray> Modem have type is Vicomm.
<Phx> What is the maximum baud rate?
<Ray> Approximate 2400-3000 bits per second.
<Phx> Fast huh? ;)
<Phx> Where do you plug it?
<Phx> Does the pentagon have a comm (rs-232) port?
<Ray> Vicomm modem is connected in tape port of the spectrum.
<Ray> In pentagon, scorpion and polyhedron not have comm port.
<Phx> Ok.  The  polyhedron ...  That's  your  new speccy  clone
      project, right?
<Ray> This project is saving for a platform a Spectrum.
<Ray> It essentially new implementation of a platform.
<Ray> This platform will allow  of the game on a Spectrum colour
      without change of the code.
<Phx> How do you do that????????????
<Ray> It will be given  with the new concept of  construction of
      home computers.
<Phx> Erm... ok.
<Ray> It is very  a pity, that I  while poorly know the  English
      language.
<Phx> That's ok, please continue ...
<Ray> Now we select element base for implementation and I  think
      that all will be ready to summer.
<Phx> Can you estimate a price for the finished product?
<Ray> 40$ - mother board
<Ray> In it computer 256 kB RAM
<Ray> In full construction it computer ~60-70$
<Phx> That's very cheap!
<Phx> What processor will you be using? 
<Ray> Z80 frequency 7 meghertz.
<Phx> Like scorpion?
<Ray> Yes.
<Ray> in the next models it will have a Z380.
<Phx> That sounds interesting...
<Phx> What sound chip? Just AY?
<Ray> While that just AY8910.
<Ray> It computer work in scorpion mode , 48 mode, 128 mode  and
      in ZM_Polyhedron mode.
<Phx> What's the difference in zm_polyhedron mode?
<Ray> All your black-white games will become color.
<Phx> I can't see how you can do that without re-programming the
      game ...
<Ray> There is a possibility, but it nobody knows.
<Phx> Ok ... i get the picture. (nurse! ;-)
<Ray> It  very powerful  construction of  the home  computer and
      such yet were not.
<Phx> Oh... i see. (not!)
<Ray> We  now want  to open  the corporation  for manufacture of
      this computer.
<Ray> Our corporation will be named "Fenix computers".
<Phx> Nice name ... ;)
<Phx> Will polyhedron be in a tower or desktop case?
<Ray> Mother board of the  polyhedron is very small and  it will
      be in what the buyer wants in.
<Phx> Cool.
<Phx> And the keyboard? PC like?
<Ray> It is very a pity,  that I have not the direct  channel of
      delivery of details because of a boundary keyboard by  and
      PC and ZX.
<Phx> ????????
<Ray> Keyboard will by ZX, and possible connect PC over  special
      card.
<Phx> Ok ... 
<Phx> Will it be tr-dos based?
<Ray> Yes it be tr-dos based.
<Phx> 5 1/4" or 3 1/2"?
<Ray> I think, that will be 5 1/4 " .
<Phx> Will it have pentagon or scorpion timings?
<Ray> In my computer , CPU will by work without steps of  delay,
      so will be as Pentagon.
<Ray> I here  recently have made  slightly colour After  the War
      game,  and  it was  very   interesting to  play  in colour
      variant of this game.
<Phx> I  still  can't  figure  out  how  it's  done  without re
      -programming the whole game ...
<Ray> To know how it is necessary :)
<Ray> Then everyone learn (find  out) as it easily color  on the
      spectrum it is really.
<Phx> Ok - thanks for everything!!!
