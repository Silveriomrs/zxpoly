       ZX-Poly is an attempt to resolve ZX-Spectrum restriction and provide way to remove attribute clash issue. The idea of the platform was developed by Igor Maznitsa in april 1994, the first emulator was developed in 1998 and the current emulator was developed in 2014 to prove work of the idea.<br>
       The platform proves that it was possible for us to have a multi-CPU home platform in the middle of 80th and old games and utilities could be adapted either for full color mode with 16 colors per pixel or high resolution 512x384.
