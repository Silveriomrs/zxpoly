      ZX-Poly is attempt to jump over ZX-Spectrum limits and get way to have graphics without atribute clash. The
      idea of the platform was developed by Igor Maznitsa in april 1994. The first emulator was developed in 1998 and
      the current emulator was developed in 2014 to prove the idea.
      <br><br>
      By default the emulator emulates ZX-Poly platform but it is possible to turn on ZX-128 mode through item in <b>Options</b>
      menu.

  <h3>Emulation of Spec256</h3>
  Since 2.0.1 version, the emulator provides minimalistic support for <a
          href="http://www.emulatronia.com/emusdaqui/spec256/index-eng.htm">Spec256</a> games. <a
          href="http://www.emulatronia.com/emusdaqui/spec256/index-eng.htm">Spec256</a> games must be zipped and contain
  SNA file in its archive. Because emulation based on multiple parallel working CPU (instead virtual 64 bit CPU in the
  original emulator), some games can work not well.
